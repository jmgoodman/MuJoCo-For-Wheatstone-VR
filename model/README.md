# info
all models that were included with MuJoCo Pro (plus a custom version of `arm26.xml` which specifies an interpupillary distance and sets the skybox to a pitch black color) are here for completeness' sake.
with that said, only scene.xml is used in the current (as of 28.05.2021) version of this work-in-progress.
